# histogram on a specific grid

Constructs the frequencies of a set of points on a specific grid.

The main point of this code is to get a histogram over the surface of a sphere. The grid was calculated and set up on a file, so the histogram is built by calculating and counting the minimum distance vector for each point to each grid vector.
